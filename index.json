Recently a new theoretical model was proposed, for a binary WD, where the primary WD explodes via a double detonation (despite being of sub-Chandrasekhar mass) while the secondary WD survives and is ejected away. This has been called a \"dynamically-driven double-degenerate double-detonation\" or D^6. The discovery of hypervelocity stars with GAIA supports this scenario. As part of our ongoing project of making the connection between the explosion physics and the remnant dynamics, we simulated in 3D the evolution of a D6 SN into the SNR phase, up to thousands of years after the explosion. Assuming a uniform ambient medium, we reveal specific signatures of the progenitor system and explosion mechanism. In particular the companion WD produces a large conical shadow in the ejecta. Our work shows the intrinsic diversity of thermonuclear SNe and their remnants.","tags":["pro"],"title":"\"A double detonation in a double degenerate system, from Type Ia supernova to supernova remnant\"","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1659657600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1659657600,"objectID":"050ad13b123203420d6eac2c4787b055","permalink":"https://gillesferrand.github.io/talk/nufact/","publishdate":"2022-09-14T23:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/nufact/","section":"talk","summary":"Visualization is an essential part of research, both to explore one’s data and to communicate one’s findings with others.

Can we use the SNR morphology as a probe of the explosion mechanism? Recent work has shown the interest of this approach for a core-collapse SNR like Cas A. Here we argue for the case of a Type Ia SNR like Tycho. Our project is making the link between two communities, the one studying the explosion and the one studying the remnant. We have run 3D simulations of a SNR starting from the output of a 3D simulation of the thermonuclear explosion of a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf. By analyzing the wavefronts we have quantified the imprint of the explosion on the remnant over time. Assuming a uniform ambient medium, we find that the impact of the SN on the SNR may still be visible after hundreds of years. And interestingly, the newly simulated maps look more realistic than in previous works based on spherically symmetric ejecta profiles.","tags":["pro"],"title":"\"From the thermonuclear supernova to the supernova remnant\"","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1560297600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560297600,"objectID":"2775109a3f70bf72a66bb78e1bb1770d","permalink":"https://gillesferrand.github.io/talk/xmm/","publishdate":"2020-01-04T18:23:23+09:00","relpermalink":"/talk/xmm/","section":"talk","summary":"Supernova remnants (SNRs) are the outcome of supernovae (SNe, either core-collapse or thermonuclear). The remnant results from the interaction between the stellar ejecta and the ambient medium around the progenitor star. Young SNRs are characterized by strong shocks that heat and ionize the gas, generate (magneto-)hydrodynamic turbulence, and accelerate particles to relativistic energies. They radiate at all wavelengths, especially in the X-ray domain, where spectro-imaging observations can provide a wealth of information. In this talk I will present recent progress in the modelling of SNRs, particularly by the means of numerical simulations, and with a focus on three-dimensional aspects. In the first part we will consider SNRs as producers of cosmic rays (CRs). If SNRs are accelerators efficient enough to power the Galactic component of CRs, this must have a visible impact on their dynamics, and therefore on the thermal emission from the plasma, as well as on their non-thermal emission. In the second part we will consider SNRs as probes of the explosion mechanism. The time has come to connect simulations of SNe and simulations of SNRs, opening the possibility to study the explosion mechanism via the dynamics and morphology of SNRs.","tags":["pro"],"title":"\"Modelling and simulations of supernova remnants\"","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1524268800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524268800,"objectID":"6ff09b0e08998ce101523e6401e2dcc0","permalink":"https://gillesferrand.github.io/project/vr/","publishdate":"2018-04-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/vr/","section":"project","summary":"Exploring immersive 3D visualization for research and for outreach.\nVR/advanced viz group","tags":["projects"],"title":"Virtual Reality","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1510012800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1510012800,"objectID":"ef0472fd680b5699ddad3cb673f272a3","permalink":"https://gillesferrand.github.io/talk/abblworkshop/","publishdate":"2020-01-04T18:23:59+09:00","relpermalink":"/talk/abblworkshop/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["pro"],"title":"\"3D simulations of young supernova remnants\"","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"3ac26decee7888c12f75cc373c751f76","permalink":"https://gillesferrand.github.io/project/cirada/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cirada/","section":"project","summary":"The Canadian Initiative for Radio Astronomy Data Analysis","tags":["collab"],"title":"CIRADA","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1465430400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1465430400,"objectID":"b92074568548262f124f94a8c119b063","permalink":"https://gillesferrand.github.io/talk/snrodyssey/","publishdate":"2020-01-04T18:24:09+09:00","relpermalink":"/talk/snrodyssey/","section":"talk","summary":"Within our Galaxy, supernova remnants are believed to be the major sources of cosmic rays up to the knee. However important questions remain regarding the share of the hadronic and leptonic components, and the fraction of the supernova energy channelled into these components. We address such question by the means of numerical simulations that combine a hydrodynamic treatment of the shock wave with a kinetic treatment of particle acceleration. Performing 3D simulations allows us to produce synthetic projected maps and spectra of the thermal and non-thermal emission, that can be compared with multi-wavelength observations (in radio, X-rays, and gamma-rays).\nSupernovae come in different types, and although their energy budget is of the same order, their remnants have different properties, and so may contribute in different ways to the pool of Galactic cosmic-rays. Our first simulations were focused on thermonuclear supernovae, like Tycho's SNR, that usually occur in a mostly undisturbed medium. Here we present our 3D simulations of core-collapse supernovae, like the Cas A SNR, that occur in a more complex medium bearing the imprint of the wind of the progenitor star.","tags":["pro"],"title":"\"3D simulations of young supernova remnants with efficient particle acceleration: thermo-nuclear vs. core-collapse\"","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1433116800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1433116800,"objectID":"1bd0458a4c86fb3a13f1137e21cd07c8","permalink":"https://gillesferrand.github.io/project/cta/","publishdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cta/","section":"project","summary":"The observatory for ground-based gamma-ray astronomy","tags":["collab"],"title":"Cherenkov Telescope Array","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1423094400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1423094400,"objectID":"0d389d2ccea7d3a306631cbb4a3ce75e","permalink":"https://gillesferrand.github.io/talk/aceartinc/","publishdate":"2020-01-04T16:15:44+09:00","relpermalink":"/talk/aceartinc/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["pub"],"title":"\"Art \u0026 Astronomy: intersections and oppositions\"","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1416441600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1416441600,"objectID":"4f208573dbbbb81a5ea1697ffb629bbe","permalink":"https://gillesferrand.github.io/talk/astronight/","publishdate":"2020-01-04T16:30:33+09:00","relpermalink":"/talk/astronight/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["pub"],"title":"\"Astrophotography: basics of imaging the night sky\"","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1352160000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1352160000,"objectID":"7dedf15def63179d75bd6e715b119075","permalink":"https://gillesferrand.github.io/project/accelrsn/","publishdate":"2012-11-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/accelrsn/","section":"project","summary":"Simulating the effects of efficient particle acceleration in supernova remnants.","tags":["projects"],"title":"AccelRSN","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1328140800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1328140800,"objectID":"7f7c61b5c8ed725bff2247831bf5a6e6","permalink":"https://gillesferrand.github.io/project/snrcat/","publishdate":"2012-02-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/snrcat/","section":"project","summary":"An up-to-date catalogue of high-energy observations of all Galactic supernova remnants.\nsnrcat.physics.umanitoba.ca","tags":["projects"],"title":"SNRcat","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1312675200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1312675200,"objectID":"a8001af3935761bf0872f13e4b2718c3","permalink":"https://gillesferrand.github.io/talk/rasc/","publishdate":"2020-01-04T16:30:39+09:00","relpermalink":"/talk/rasc/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["pub"],"title":"\"Supernova Remnants\"","type":"talk"}]
